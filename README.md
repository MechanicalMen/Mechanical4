===========

Mechanical4
----------------
A small "bag of tricks", commonly used in other Mechanical4 libraries. 

Mechanical4.EventQueue
----------------------
A simple event queue / message bus implementation. It's two main features are that it is strongly typed (string event identifiers are possibly, but discouraged), and that - with a minor bit of work - events can be serialized.
